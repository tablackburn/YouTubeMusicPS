# Custom Pester task, used instead of PowerShellBuild's built-in 'Pester' task.
#
# Two separate reasons it exists.
#
# 1. Version agreement. PowerShellBuild's Test-PSBuildPester runs
#    `Import-Module Pester -MinimumVersion 5.0.0`, which resolves to the *highest*
#    installed version. Pester 6 also re-resolves Describe by autoloading during
#    its per-file discovery, and autoload likewise picks the highest installed
#    version -- so an exact pin is never actually honoured. Whenever the runner
#    image ships something newer than the pin, the two collide:
#
#      An incompatible version of the Pester.dll assembly is already loaded.
#
#    Pester 6.0.1 arrived 2026-07-18 and 6.1.0 on 2026-08-11, breaking CI both
#    times with no commit to blame. build.depend.psd1 therefore uses
#    Version = 'latest' and this task imports the highest installed version, so
#    PSDepend, this task and Pester's autoload all agree and cannot collide.
#    Do not narrow either back to an exact version without changing the other.
#
# 2. Failed containers. PowerShellBuild's gate throws only on FailedCount, which
#    cannot see a test file that died during discovery -- it generates no tests
#    at all, so zero failures reads as success. See the gate below.
